# Random Python projects

Goals:

I) Learn multiple Python libraries
  1) Learn multiple levels of abstraction of Python coding (from low level data and memory processing, to OOP, to Artificial Intelligence, Visualization, HUD)
  2) Learn specific librairies and levels of abstraction through projects and applied theoretical knowledge which improves understanding
     a) Make projects that are interesting to you and that provide value to you or others, meaningful projects
     b) Use online tutorials, MOOCS, youtube videos, notebooks, Repositories, to learn directly (Books in coding are overrated ?)
  3) Study algorithms, famous codes, companies and startups, research paper (Deepmind, openAI, Meta, for example). Try to recreate them, modify them, improve them, 
     integrate them into different environnements, for different tasks, different HUD, etc... (Play with it)

II) Make a larger project integrating the multiple levels of abstraction, iterative on it to aggregate more and more functionnalities
